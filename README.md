a pro team static webpage using react + vite; to show my level of understanding of basic react concepts such as elements, components, props, conditional styling and .map( )

I just started to learn about front-end development, so I started by learning how to install react+vite, use basic tailwindcss, use elements as reusable components and finally using the .map() method to iterate a particular array of elements (in this case, the user) to create corresponding html elements (profile cards).
